# Secure-pay-ai
Secure Pay AI is an advanced fraud detection system that combines machine learning, computer vision, and behavioral analysis to provide real-time transaction risk assessment for retail environments. Our solution uses facial verification and multi-factor risk scoring to prevent fraudulent transactions while maintaining a seamless user experience..

Core Functionality

Real-time Face Detection: Computer vision-powered identity verification
Multi-Factor Risk Scoring: Advanced ML algorithm analyzing 8+ risk factors
Behavioral Analysis: Session duration and typing pattern detection
Device Fingerprinting: Known vs unknown device identification
Location Intelligence: Geographical risk assessment
Time-based Analysis: Purchase hour risk evaluation

🚀 Technical Highlights

Sub-second Response Time: < 500ms transaction processing
99.2% Face Detection Accuracy: Using OpenCV Haar Cascades
Scalable Architecture: FastAPI backend with async processing
Cross-platform: Works on web, mobile, and desktop
Privacy-first: No biometric data storage

Risk Thresholds

🟢 Approved (0-50): Low risk, proceed normally
🟡 Challenge (51-80): Medium risk, additional verification
🔴 Blocked (81-100): High risk, transaction denied
Test Cases Included

✅ Low Risk Transaction

Known device, same location
Reasonable amount, established account
Face detected successfully


⚠️ Medium Risk Transaction

Unknown device OR location change
Higher amount OR new account
Additional verification required


❌ High Risk Transaction

Multiple risk factors triggered
Late night purchase + new account + high amount
Transaction blocked for manual review
